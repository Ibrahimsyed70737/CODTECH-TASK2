## **Objective:**
The objective of this code is to develop and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. 

## **Key Activities:**
1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Loading Data**: Fetch and load the California Housing dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Create a DataFrame and display its first few rows.
    - Select specific features for the model.
    - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler`.
4. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.
6. **Model Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
8. **Results Visualization**: 
    - Plot the actual vs. predicted prices.
    - Display and visualize the feature coefficients to understand their importance in the model.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizations.
  - **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation).

## **Overview:**
This script demonstrates the complete workflow for building a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. The process involves importing required libraries, loading and preprocessing data, splitting data into training and testing sets, training the model, making predictions, evaluating the model, and visualizing the results. The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R², and the importance of each feature is visualized through their coefficients.
